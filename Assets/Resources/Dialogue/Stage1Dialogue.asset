  Intro:
  - "You must be the new containment operative. I\u2019m your remote handler\u2014call
    me Oracle."
  - "I\u2019ll be your oversight for this operation. Try not to make me fill another
    casualty report."
  - "I\u2019ll keep communication brief. You search, I monitor. Simple enough."
  - This room was flagged after reports of spatial distortion and loss of contact
    with prior staff.
  - Local reality inside the containment zone is unstable. The cause is believed
    to be one or more anomalous objects.
  - Everything inside has been untouched since the event. Your task is to locate
    the source and secure it for analysis.
  - "I cannot enter with you. The interference scrambles my sensors beyond the door.
    You\u2019ll be my hands inside."
  - This threshold marks the safe limit. Beyond that, even my instruments start bleeding
    data.
  - "Move through the room carefully. Observe each object\u2014furniture, tools,
    even debris."
  - "Hold the object steady while I analyze. I\u2019ll confirm if it\u2019s abnormal\u2014and
    whether it\u2019s the main source."
  - "Some items may react violently to touch or proximity. If the environment starts
    to distort\u2014move away."
